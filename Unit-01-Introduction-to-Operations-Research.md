## History of Operations Research

Operations Research (OR) is a relatively new discipline that began systematically in the late 1930s in the UK. It wasn't a university subject 70 years ago, but today, it plays a crucial role in decision-making across various fields.

### Early Developments in the 1930s

- **1936**: The British Air Ministry established Bawdsey Research Station for radar experiments. This led to early OR work, integrating radar data with ground observations for fighter interception.
- **1937**: The first major air-defense exercise used radar data, revealing the need for better tracking information.
- **1938**: A second exercise highlighted the problem of coordinating information from multiple radar stations. A.P. Rowe from Bawdsey proposed a research program into the operational aspects of radar systems, coining the term "operational research."
- **1939**: The last pre-war air defense exercise showed improvements due to OR contributions. The Stanmore Research Section was formed, later becoming the Operational Research Section (ORS).

### Contributions During World War II

- **1940**: The Stanmore Research Section analyzed aircraft losses for Winston Churchill, influencing the decision not to send additional fighter squadrons to France, which contributed to the success of the Battle of Britain.
- **1941 onward**: ORS was established in Coastal Command, conducting significant OR work, especially in anti-submarine warfare.

### Post-War Expansion

- **1951**: The National Research Council of the USA formed a committee on OR, and Morse and Kimball published the first book on OR methods.
- **1952**: The Operations Research Society of America was established.
- **Industrial Applications**: Success in the military led to OR being adopted by industrial managers for complex business problems. Today, OR is used in various government departments and industries worldwide.

### OR in India

- **1949**: The first OR unit was established at the Regional Research Laboratory in Hyderabad.
- **1953**: An OR unit was set up at the Indian Statistical Institute in Calcutta for national planning.
- **1955**: The Operations Research Society of India was formed, becoming an early member of the International Federation of Operations Research Societies.
