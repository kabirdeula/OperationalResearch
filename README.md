# Course Title: Operational Research (3 Cr.)

Course Code: **CAOR451**

Year/ Semester: **IV/VIII**

Class Load: **4Hrs. /Week (Theory: 3 Hrs. Tutorial: 1 Hrs)**

## Course Description

Operational Research is the study of scientific approaches to decision-making. Through mathematical modeling, it seeks to design, improve and operate complex systems in the best possible way. The mathematical tools used for the solution of such models are either deterministic or stochastic, depending on the nature of the system modeled. In addition, the course will learn very powerful modeling and solution techniques for decision-making problems that are used today by many successful companies to help them save/earn millions of dollars. The module covers topics that include: linear programming, transportation, assignment, inventory control, replacement theory and game theory. Analytic techniques and computer packages will be used to solve problems facing business managers in decision environments

### Course Objective

The general objectives of this course to provide a broad orientation of the field of optimization, with emphasis on basic theory and methods for continuous and discrete optimization problems in finite dimension, and it also gives some insight into its use for analyzing practical optimization problems.
