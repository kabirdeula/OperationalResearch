# Practice Questions

1. A firm manufactures three products A, B, C. Time to manufacture product A is twice that for B and thrice that for C and to be produced in the ratio 3:4:5. The relevant data is given in the following table. If the whole raw material is engaged in manufacturing product A, 1600 units of this product can be produced. There is demand for at least 300, 250, 200 units of product A, B, and C and the profit earned per unit is Rs. 50, Rs. 40, Rs. 70 respectively. Formulate the problem as a linear programming problem.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th rowspan=2>Raw Material</th>
        <th colspan=3>Requirement per unit of product (kg)</th>
        <th rowspan=2>Total Availability (kg)</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>A</th>
        <th>B</th>
        <th>C</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>P</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>5000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Q</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>6000</td>
    </tr>

2. Find the optimal solution for the following transaction problem using any methods.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <th>30</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <th>50</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>9</td>
        <th>20</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>20</th>
        <th>40</th>
        <th>30</th>
        <th>9</th>
        <th>100</th>
    </tr>
</table>

3. Use duality to solve the LPP

```
    Minimize 𝑧 = 4𝑥₁ + 2𝑥₂ + 3𝑥₃
    Subject to
                2𝑥₁ + 4𝑥₃ ≥ 5
                2𝑥₁ + 3𝑥₂ + 𝑥₃ ≥ 4
                𝑥₁, 𝑥₂, 𝑥₃ = 0
```

4. A Scooter with first cost Rs. 20,000 has depreciation and service pattern as given below:

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Year</th>
        <th>1</th>
        <th>2</th>
        <th>3</th>
        <th>4</th>
        <th>5</th>
        <th>6</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Depreciation</th>
        <td>28000</td>
        <td>20000</td>
        <td>14000</td>
        <td>5000</td>
        <td>4000</td>
        <td>4000</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Annual Service Charge</th>
        <td>18000</td>
        <td>21000</td>
        <td>25000</td>
        <td>29000</td>
        <td>34000</td>
        <td>40000</td>
    </tr>
</table>
    
    How many years should the Scooter be kept in service before replacement?
