# Simplex Practice Questions 2

1. A factory has decided to diversify its activities. The data collected by sales and production department is summarized below. Potential demand exists for three products A, B and C. Market can take any amount of A and C. Whereas the share of B for this organization is expected to be not more than 400 units a month.

For every 3 units of C produced, there will be one unit of by-product which sells at a contribution of Rs.3 a unit and only 100 units of this by-product can be sold per month. Contribution per unit of products A, B &C is expected to be Rs. 6, 8,4 respectively. These products require three different processes and the time required per unit product is given in the table below,

<table>
    <tr>
        <th rowspan = 2>Process</th>
        <th colspan = 3>Hours/Unit</th>
        <th rowspan = 2>Available hours</th>        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Product A</th>
        <th>Product B</th>
        <th>Product C</th>        
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>I</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>900</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>II</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>600</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>III</td>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>1200</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Determine the optimum product mix for maximizing the contribution.

2. Solve by using Simplex Method

```
    Maximize 𝐙 = 8𝑥₁ - 3𝑥₂
    Subject to
            𝑥₁ + 2𝑥₂ ≤ 7
            2𝑥₁ + 4𝑥₂ ≥ 14
            𝑥₁ = 5 and 𝑥₂ ≥ 0
```

3. Solve by using Simplex Method

```
    Maximize 𝐙 = 3𝑥₁ + 2𝑥₂ + 5𝑥₃
    Subject to
            𝑥₁ + 𝑥₂ + 𝑥₃ ≤ 9
            2𝑥₁ + 3𝑥₂ + 5𝑥₃ ≤ 30
            2x1 - x2 - 𝑥₃ ≤ 8
            x1, x2, 𝑥₃ ≥ 0
```

4. Solve by using Simplex Method

```
    Minimize 𝐙 = 20𝑥₁ + 10𝑥₂
    Subject to
            𝑥₁ + 2𝑥₂ ≤ 40
            3𝑥₁ + 𝑥₂ ≥ 30
            4x1 + 3x2 ≥ 60
            x1, x2 ≥ 0
```
