# Unit 07 - Game Theory

## Two Persons Zero Sum Game

1. The game with saddle point (Pure strategy)
2. The game without saddle point (Mixed Strategy)

| Player A's strategies | B1  | B2  | .   | Bn  |
| --------------------- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1                    | P11 | P12 | .   | P1n |
| A2                    | P21 | P22 | .   | P2n |

Game with saddle point

| Player's A Strategy | B1  | B2  | B3  |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1                  | 30  | 60  | 50  |
| A2                  | 35  | 45  | 40  |

| Player's A Strategy | B1  | B2  | B3  | Row Minima |
| ------------------- | --- | --- | --- | ---------- |
| A1                  | 30  | 60  | 50  | 30         |
| A2                  | 35  | 45  | 40  | 35         |
| Column Maxima       | 35  | 60  | 50  |

35 being minimax and maximin

Maximin == Minimax (Saddle Point Exits)

The corresponding strategies to saddle point are A2 and B1. So the optimal strategy for player A is A2 and optimal strategy for Player B is B1.
The game value is 35.

## Games without saddle point

1. Algebraic method

2. Arithmetic Method

3. Calculus Method

4. Matrix Method

5. Graphic Method

6. Linear Programming Method

7. Dominance Rule Method

- The payoff matrix of the game played between two players A and B is given below

|     | B1  | B2  | Probability |
| --- | --- | --- | ----------- |
